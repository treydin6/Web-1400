      <p>I would say that I am quite the adventurous person, I have a lot of things that I would like to do in my life time. One of the biggest Items on my bucket list Is to travel to every continent except Antartica. The first area I plan to travel to Is Europe, since I grew up playing soccer and with soccer being so big In Europe I want to travel there first. I plan to take my mom on a Mediteranian cruise and after go visit several countries in Europe. After I travel to Europe I don't have a specific order of where I will travel to next, I just plan to visit every continent and several of there countries. Another Item on my bucket list Is to watch a world cup final in person. It has alway been a dream of mine to go to the world cup but I would like to watch the final. Growing up being a soccer player, summer every four years Is a great time because Its the biggest tournament for soccer. Another bucket list item is to visit the great pyramids in Egypt, The history behind the pyramids Is crazy and I want to at least have an idea of how big they really are.</p>
