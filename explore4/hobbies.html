    <p>I personally am more of an outdoors and adventurous type person. One of my favorite things to do is go hiking and be in the mountains. One of my main hobbies Is playing soccer, I have played soccer since I was five years old and I am currently on the school soccer team. before transferring to dixie I played at Otero junior college in southern Colorado for two years. playing soccer has brought some great travel opportunities for me, taking me all across the west coast including Hawaii and to several states on the east coast. With traveling for soccer it has sparked interest for me to travel. I love exploring new places and plan to travel to every continent except Antartica. Another hobby is mountain biking. a big decision factor in me signing to dixie state was how much mountain biking st George has to offer. I purchased my first mountain bike this summer and I am excited to explore new trails. St George has some of the best trails in the world to mountain bike and I plan to ride most of them. Finally I love listening to music, there is music that I like to listen to for every mood I am In. From upbeat dance from Calvin harris or rap music from the Notorious B.I.G I love all types of music and it has become a passion to explore new music.</p>
