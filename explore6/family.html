        <p>My family started in Magna, Utah where my parents bought there first house together and that Is where my older sister and I were born. When I was about 2 years old we moved from Magna to Tooele, Utah. We lived there until i was 5 years old and from there we moved to West Jordan, Utah and we lived here until I was 8 yearls old and then my parents bought there dream home In Herriman Utah. We lived there for about a year and then my little sister was born. At this time It was my dad Matt, my mom Angiee, My older sister Jess, my younger sister Kamiiyn, and myself. My dad loves to go hunting and camping. During summer If he has any free time he Is usually taking his trailer up the Wasatch mountains. My mom Is a nurse and she loves to give back or help people In need. Old people tend to freak me out but she loves to help them back Into good health. I love spending time with my family but with them living in Salt Lake and me going to school In St. George it makes It hard to see them A lot. One of my favorite things to do with my family is going on family vacations. Going to California Is one thing we can always agree on as a family.</p>
