REBEL U-WING FIGHTER

<!-- appropriate image goes here -->

Open the cockpit and place the U-Wing Pilot in his seat. Fire up the engines and launch into the sky. Keep a lookout below with the transparent window, and when you spot the enemy, fire the front spring-loaded shooters and stud shooters mounted in the side doors. You can even fold the wings back for a bigger model!



KRENNIC'S IMPERIAL SHUTTLE

<!-- appropriate image goes here -->

When a tough transport ship is needed, Krennic's Imperial Shuttle is the perfect choice. Put him into the pilot seat, open out the thick-armor plating and seat the Death Troopers. Lower the ramp and check the blasters are secured, then arm the spring-loaded shooters and seal the hull for takeoff. Raise the landing skids, lower the wings for flight mode and set off on another dangerous mission!



DEATH STAR

<!-- appropriate image goes here -->

Take command of the ultimate Imperial weapon&mdash;the Death Star! This amazing Star Wars model has so many great rooms, chambers, hangars and more, you won’t know where to start. Operate the giant superlaser from the control room, plan missions in the conference chamber, and launch Lord Vader's TIE Advanced from the hangar bay. Fix Droids in the maintenance room, keep prisoners secure in the detention block and overpower rebel starships with the spring-loaded shooter turbo laser, turbo laser towers and powerful tractor beam. You can even visit Emperor Palpatine in his throne room, keep things moving in the cargo area, and take out the trash in the trash compactor. And of course no Death Star story would be complete without Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo doing their best to destroy the Empire's fearsome Death Star! Will they foil the plans of Vader and the other Imperial characters? The fate of the Death Star is in your hands…
